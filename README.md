The rise and grind experience, whitout ui, intrunctions how to play and most important the worst graphics anyone can make, Sisifo doesn't even have a animation yet.

the command to compile is:

    g++ -c src/*.cpp -std=c++14 -Wall -m64 -I include -I /DL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include && g++ *.o -o bin/main.exe -s -L SDL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image && start bin/main
